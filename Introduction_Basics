Cloud Computing is term meaning delivery of computing resources -servers,storage and network over internet and can be accessed from  anywhere and anytime

Benefits of Cloud:
1)Low capital expenditure
2)Pay as u use 
3)Utility based pricing
4)Secure Storage Management
5)24 * 7 support

Benefits of Bigdata on AWS:
1)Broad range of services to help you build and deploy big data analytics
applications quickly and easily
2)Fast access to flexible and low cost IT resources
3)Rapidly scale any bigdata application
4)With AWS no investments of time and money to build infrastructure

--> AWS provides ability to build any big data analytics application,support any workload
regardless of volume,velocity and variety of data
-->Bigdata analytics is the process of examining large and verified datasets  to uncover the hidden
patterns,relations and market trends.
-->Helps organization to make critical business decisions with ease.

Bigdata Analytics Framework:

1)Amazon EMR(Hadoop and Spark)
2)Interactive Query Service(Amazon Athena)
3)Elastic search(Amazon Elastic search service)

Streaming Data 
---When the live data is captured  from various sources and
start analysing them  while the data is still travelling from 
source to the target
We use Amazon Kinesis for loading streaming data
--Amazon Kinesis Firehose
--Amazon Kinesis Analytics
--Amazon Kinesis Streams

BIGDATA STORAGES AND DATABASES:
===============================

1)Object Storage - Amazon S3
2)Graph Databases - Amazon Dynamo DB for TITAN
3)NoSQL - Amazon Dynamo DB
4)Hbase on AMazon EMR
5)MySQL - Amazon Aurora
6)AMazon Relational Databases

DATA WAREHOUSING
================
For storing huge volumes of historical data,you always require data warehouse
--A peta byte  scale data warehousing solution(Redshift)
--Its about creating a data warehouse without bothering about the huge servers and huge
databases

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
=====================
Defn - Extracting the data from various sources,transforming the data,visualizing the data and then loading it into various other sources
Amazon Quicksight provides a fast cloud  powered BI solution for the 1/10 th the cost of traditional setup of the BI tools
1)It allows you to connect to the various AWS data services and upload the data and the files to the quicksight solutions
2)Provides in memory calculation engine
3)Provides a UI where you can visualize the data and do the trend analysis

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
=====================
1)AWS provides cloud native Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to address broad set of use cases and various needs
i)Amazon Lex
ii)Amazon Polly
iii)Amazon Rekognition
iv)Amazon Machine Learning

COMPUTE
=====================
For doing any kind of analysis,you would require a compute application

Compute is a platform where computations will be done
1)Serverless Compute(AWS Lambda)
2)Compute Services Instance Types(Amazon EC2 Instances)


Data Movement
================
Movement of data into the cloud and around the cloud
1)AWS Direct Connectivity- AWS Direct Connect
2)Database Migration - AWS Snowball
3)Hybrid Cloud Storage - AWS Storage Gateway
